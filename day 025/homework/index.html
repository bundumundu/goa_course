    <h1>The Nissan Skyline (Japanese: 日産・スカイライン, Hepburn: Nissan Sukairain) is a brand of automobile originally produced by the Prince Motor Company starting in 1957, and then by Nissan after the two companies merged in 1967. After the merger, the Skyline and its larger counterpart, the Nissan Gloria, were sold in Japan at dealership sales channels called Nissan Prince Shop. Starting in 1968 with the third generation C10, the chassis, suspension and some of the engines were shared with the longer wheelbase Nissan Laurel. When the formerly Prince factory at Musashimurayama was closed in 2002, the Skyline instead shared its platform with the Nissan 350Z.</h1>
