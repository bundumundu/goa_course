    <p class="p">computer proggraming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called <span>programs</span>, that <span>computers</span> can follow to perform tasks. it involves designing and implementing <span>algorithms</span>, step-by-step specifications of producers, by writing <span>code</span> in one or more <span>programming languages</span>. programmers typically use <span>high-level proggraming languages</span> that are more easly intelligable to humans than <span>machine code</span>, which is directly executed by the <span>central proccesing unit</span>. proficent proggraming ussualy requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the <span>application domain</span>, details of proggraming languages and generic code <span>libaries</span>, specialized algorithms , and <span>formal logic</span>.</p>
